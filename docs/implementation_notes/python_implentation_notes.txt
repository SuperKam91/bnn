- Python lists are stored as variable-length arrays of pointers, which point to objects. These arrays are contiguous, and when appended to, may require relocating as with std::vectors in c++.iews referenc
- NumPy arrays are fixed size vectors, where the total size of the array is constant since the arrays can only store a certain type e.g. float64. NumPy functions utilise vectorsation, and pre-compiled functions written in c/fortran. Views reference the underlying array without making a copy. Some NumPy functions are non-parallel, some use multi-threading, some use multi-processing. Depends on nature of the function, and what functions they are built upon (e.g. BLAS etc.).
- Pandas columns (series) are just NumPy arrays. Columns of the same type are stored in the same block. Apparently you can only use one core at a time when doing computation on pandas dataframes.
- Modin-pandas provides a parallel extension to pandas, which provides parallel dataframes (which can be processed by multiple cores simultaneously). Seems to work out of the box on a single node (computer), but for clusters of computers, think it is a work in progress.
- JSON is a language neutral data interchange format. It is less verbose and easier to parse than XML. Converting to and from JSON format is known as serialising and deserialising data. Different objects are serialised to different JSON objects, and vice versa.
- Pickle is a python-specific data format. Unlike JSON, the serialised data is not human-readable, it is in binary format. It works with more exotic python objects than JSON. As with JSON, serialising (pickling) is done with the dump keyword, deserialising (depickling) is done with the load keyword.
- A relational database is a collection of data items with pre-defined relationships between them. These items are organised as a set of tables with columns and rows. Each row in a table could be marked with a unique identifier called a primary key, and rows among multiple tables can be made related using foreign keys. This data can be accessed in many different ways without reorganizing the database tables themselves. Uses SQL to query data
- HDF5 files are hierarchical sets of multidimensional arrays which store data. They can be thought of as a smarter way to store folders of files. They store data of same type.
- Join merges tables column-wise, union merges them row-wise.
