- links to pages with suggestions on how to calculate the Bayesian evidence using Monte Carlo methods:

https://stats.stackexchange.com/questions/209810/computation-of-the-marginal-likelihood-from-mcmc-samples
seems there is no consensus on method to use, but nested sampling is suggested (but is rumoured to be inefficient).
- Xi'an blog post commenting on Heaven's paper on evidence estimation using MCMC techniques. Slates the paper, but provides interesting references:
